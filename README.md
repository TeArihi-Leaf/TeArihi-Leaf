## Kia ora, I’m Te Arihi aka Tee 👋🏽 

I’m a people-focused junior web developer and Dev Academy Aotearoa graduate. I come from a background in customer service, digital content creation, and community engagement, and I enjoy combining tech and creativity to build thoughtful, user-friendly applications. 

I learn best by building, collaborating with others, and reflecting on what worked (and what didn’t). I’m especially motivated by projects that support real people, small businesses, and community driven work.

## 🌍 Projects

### 💬 Messaging App — Team Project  
A real-time messaging app built in a small team during bootcamp. Users can log in, manage friendships, and chat with others in real time.

**My contribution:**

**What I learned:**
- How important clear communication is when working in a team  
- Debugging alongside others when things didn’t work the first time  
- Working under time pressure and adjusting as we went
